/*
Find whether a given number is a power of 2 using Brian Kernighanâ€™s algorithm:
To solve the problem follow the below idea:

As we know that the number which will be the power of two have only one set bit , therefore when we do bitwise AND with the number which is just less than the number which can be represented as the power of (2) then the result will be 0 .

Example : 4 can be represented as (2^2 ) ,
                (4 & 3)=0  or in binary (100 & 011=0)
