/*

		wrapper class = 	provides a way to use primitive data types as reference data types
	     					reference data types contain useful methods
		     				can be used with collections (ex.ArrayList)

	   primitive	  wrapper
		---------	  -------
		boolean		Boolean
		char		Character
		int			Integer
		double		Double

		** Strings already a refrence data type

	    autoboxing = the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and
		              their corresponding object wrapper classes
		unboxing = the reverse of autoboxing. Automatic conversion of wrapper class to primitive

		""---> for string
		'' ---> for char
		both are different
